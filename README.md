# I-Am-Rich


## Description/Story
In this project, I will be doing an "I Am Rich" like the app and the story behind it goes like this. So there was a guy called Amin Heinrich who created an app called I Am Rich on August 5, 2008; 12 years ago. His app was put in the art and lifestyle categories but he charged 999.99$ and all it did was just displaing an image on the screen and nothing else. The app ended up being bought by eight people and was finally put down by the apple store. You can find more information [here...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich)
